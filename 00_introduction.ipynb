    "### Lesson 0.2: Python and stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial relies on you being able to run some simple python routines. You dont have to be a very good programmer to follow this tutorial, and do not be afraid\n",
    "to ask for help from the instructors or your fellow students. We will use `jupyter`notebooks and run the code on a dedicated `jupyterhub`. The intention is that all\n",
    "the needed python libraries are already installed so you dont have to strugle with that. However, there are sometimes discrepancies between intentions and the real life...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 0.3: `cellpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the `cellpy` library for doing most of the data handling stuff. If you want to know more about the library, here are some helpful tips:\n",
